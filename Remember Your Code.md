# How to Remember Your Code When You’re Not as Young as You Used to Be

I have observed that my age has decreased live memory (RAM) capacity, leading to difficulty retaining code. To mitigate this issue, I utilize the following strategies:

Maximizing the use of comments within my code.
Implementing descriptive, lengthy naming conventions for functions and variables.
Utilizing more generic functions and classes to improve overall code organization.
In addition, I have formulated a plan to establish a clear philosophy, logical structure, and design patterns for each project via a dedicated directory. For my projects,```./philo``` directory will serve as a repository for documentation regarding the project’s philosophy and major design decisions. A ```./manifesto.md``` file will also be included to provide an overview of the project’s purpose, and a ```./philo/essays/```
directory will contain several essays detailing essential aspects of the project.
